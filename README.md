# STATS M231A- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Fall 2021, UCLA

This repo contains the six homework from STATS M231A Class. The homework/class covered classical DL algorithms such as CNN/Fully Connected Neural Network and the state-of-the-art algorithms such as BERT and GPT-2. Each sub-folder contains the code and report. Feel free to explore. The codes were executed on Google Colab utilizing their GPU capabilities.

### Disclaimer
I don't claim the authenticity of the codes used in this class. All of the homework assignments included reference code links from GitHub. I have relied on a fair amount of reference materials to produce my codes/results. Since the class website has now been deactivated, I unfortunately won't be able to cite the work.
